      <h2>Social VR Events, 2019-2020</h2>
      <p>
        As Stereoh, along with my 2 cofounders I produced a series of social VR
        events. The environments were built on an extended install of Mozilla
        Hubs with heavy customization of A-Frame and Three.js. We ran our own
        AWS servers to house the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built our website in React, did much of the A-Frame and Three.js work,
        as well as administered the AWS servers (dev+staging+prod).
