        I picked up a camera in 1994, and was immediately enamored. As my very
        first print was taking shape in the developer tray, a guy next to me
        took a look and and reacted to it in the same way I had myself. He got
        the joke! Being painfully shy back then this opened up the door to an
        alternate communication channel. I could tell jokes without uttering a
        word.

        Stepping things up, I left the Best Coast to study photography at
        Parsons School of Design.

      <p>I still shoot every day.</p>

        The work below focuses on formal elements of visual art: line, shape,
        space, color and texture. I work in a number of loosely coupled
        mediums, but this collection of images ties directly to the foundation
        upon which most of what I do is built.
