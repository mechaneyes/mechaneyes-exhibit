        Setting out on the development of this experience I considered the path
        I'd taken to get to this moment in my life. I've long had a fascination
        with maps, and thought a map would serve nicely as a guiding metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with, and
        learn from, many talented people, I've largely defined my own direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I followed no maps to get here. <br />
        No maps existed. <br />
        I've created the map as part of the process.

        Reflecting my love of California's Sierra Nevada mountains, the taxonomy
        used for categories and projects is structured around Tahoe ski resorts.
        Each category is a resort, and each project a flag planted at a mountain
        peak of that resort.
