      <h2>Better Breaks, 2022</h2>
      <p class="ital">Mapbox + Audio Visualization</p>
      <p>
        With Better Breaks I built a custom Mapbox GL JS app featuring downtown
        Sacramento. The elevations of the city's buildings are animated via
        audio reactivity. Inspiration for the color scheme came directly from
        Alex Proyas' 1998 movie, Dark City.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this project with the intent of including it in Monolyth
        experiences. Because the Monolyths will be installed throughout the
        physical world I was looking for a way to facilitate their discovery.
