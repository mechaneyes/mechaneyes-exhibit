    <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
    <p>
      Mechaneyes.com has taken many shapes over the years. I registered the
      domain and published my first web-based portfolio on it in 2004. Mutating
      over the years it's shifted from portfolio to blog (remember those?) then
      into still more iterations of portfolios with varying use cases in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Autumn/Winter 2022 edition has the site returning to it's roots,
      though this version collects more of my interests under a single umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is built chiefly using React. The map which structures the
      experience is built on Mapbox GL JS. And reflecting my love of
      California's Sierra Nevada mountains, the taxonomy used for categories and
      projects is structured around Tahoe ski resorts. Each category is a
      resort, and each project a flag planted at a mountain peak of that resort.
