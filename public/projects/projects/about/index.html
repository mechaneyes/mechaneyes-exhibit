          <h1>Ray Weitzenberg</h1>
          <p>Artist and technologist inducing delight online and off</p>
          <p>
            I'm a visual artist and technologist based in Brooklyn. In 1994, via
            the mechanism of photography, I discovered a profound appreciation
            for light. I've spent the last 28 years collecting and projecting
            that light, in part having shaped that sensibility via the lens of
            Parsons School of Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            As much as I am enamored with art, I focus my attention equally on
            digital. It's when the two passions intersect that monkeys begin to
            dance.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Senior Frontend Developer at UNIQLO I take projects from
            conceptualization, through prototyping and development and finally
            into production. Nights and weekends I spend immersed in personal
            projects. Under active development is Monolyth, a storytelling
            platform spanning simultaneous digital and physical means of
            interaction. Other recent work is actualized in AR/VR experiences,
            both mobile and immersive.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            Projects are crafted as or with bespoke apps, operating in a black
            box system often operating outside my control. The systems take
            input — which can come from any one or more sources — then processes
            it via loosely coupled constraints, resulting in imagery composed
            somewhat randomly, bordering on autonomy.
