    <h2>UNIQLO US Digital Commerce</h2>
    <p>
      I worked at UNIQLO as a frontend developer for 7 years. Over that span I
      participated in two replatforming projects, first moving from Adobe's CQ5
      to a Salesforce Reference Architecture (SFRA) site, and most recently
      migrating from SFRA to a bespoke CMS developed in house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both projects myself and the developer under me worked to massage
      content into its expected layouts, and with the latest launch we put
      extensive time into taking the site from what was essentially two separate
      CMSs and condensing everything into a single responsive code base.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to streamline the work we had done, I constructed a scaffolding
      tool that allowed us to spin up projects quickly and work on them in an
      environment that closely matched that on our staging and production
      builds. I worked with a co-developer and the design team to unify the
      styling employed on the site. While it wasn't a complete design system,
      our implementation allowed for accelerated design and development
      processes, reducing expended effort and the potential for mistakes.
