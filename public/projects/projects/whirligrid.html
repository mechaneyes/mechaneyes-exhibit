    <p class="ital">A generative art application built in Processing</p>
    <p>
      Whirligrid takes as input a source image and an array of colors. When run,
      the app arranges a defined number of the source images on a grid while at
      the same time transforming the size, rotation and opacity of those images.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source images I use are created mainly in Illustrator. I use various
      methods for generating the colorways ... sometimes pulled from Adobe
      Color, other times extracted from an existing static image of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice the app has to be run 15 or so times before generating a
      keeper. Once an image is generated it's taken into Illustrator for cleanup
      and for exploring the assignment of the colors in differeent and random
      distributions across the layout. From there it goes into Lightroom to
      further explore and perfect the colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this version of the app has been built in Processing, I'm currently
      working to rebuild the app in p5.js in order to release it as a web app
      for others to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further out I'll animate these images and to use those realtime animations
      in live events that I VJ.

      <h2>Harvey's Rollerstar, 2021</h2>

        Inspiration was taken from Wendy Wheelz performing as one of DJ Harvey's
        Angels at the open air party he played in Los Angeles in the summer of
        '21.

        State of Awareness was constructed while reflecting on time I spent with
        my mother who passed a few years ago. The piece was constructed in a
        welcome state of reverie.

      <p>
        Using the same source image as in State of Awareness, I constructed
        these pieces in the autumn of 2021 while living in Sacramento. The trees
        are a huge amenity for the city, and they absolutely shine each fall.

      <p>
        I've begun printing these designs as laptop decals soon to be followed
        with fine art prints big and small.
