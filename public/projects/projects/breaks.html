    <h2>Better Breaks, 2022</h2>
    <p class="ital">Mapbox + Audio Visualization</p>
    <p>
      With Better Breaks I built a custom Mapbox GL JS app featuring downtown
      Sacramento. The elevations of the city's buildings are animated via audio
      reactivity. Inspiration for the color scheme came directly from Alex
      Proyas' 1998 movie, Dark City.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started this project with the intent of including it in Monolyth
      experiences. Because the Monolyths will be installed throughout the
      physical world I was looking for a way to facilitate their discovery.
