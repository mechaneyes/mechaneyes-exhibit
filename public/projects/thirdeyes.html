    <h2>Third Bridge + Mechaneyes = Thirdeyes</h2>
    <p>
      Thirdeyes assists music journalists in writing artist bios. Powered behind
      the scenes by an orchestration of multiple LLMs, writers can step through
      and develop the core elements of a bio. Further assiting the writers,
      information is contextually generated as they interact with the app to
      inform upon the artist's life and work.
