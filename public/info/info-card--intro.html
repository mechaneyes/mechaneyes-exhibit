            My mediums of choice are light itself, and equally, digitally
            mediated experiences. It's when the two passions intersect that
            monkeys begin to dance.

      <p>
        I've been infatuated with art since 1994, and I've been into computers
        since saying so actually meant something. At that intersection the
         monkeys begin to dance.

      <p>Inside is a glimpse of what I see and create for others to see.</p>
