      <h3>Artist and technologist inducing delight online and off</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a visual artist and technologist based in Brooklyn. In 1994, via the
        mechanism of photography, I discovered a profound appreciation for
        light. I've spent the last 28 years collecting and projecting that
        light, in part having shaped that sensibility via the lens of Parsons
        School of Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as I am enamored with art, I focus my attention equally on
        digital. It's when the two passions intersect that monkeys begin to
        dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Senior Frontend Developer at UNIQLO I take projects from
        conceptualization, through prototyping and development and finally into
        production. Nights and weekends I spend immersed in personal projects.
        Under active development is Monolyth, a storytelling platform spanning
        simultaneous digital and physical means of interaction. Other recent
        work is actualized in AR/VR experiences, both mobile and immersive.
