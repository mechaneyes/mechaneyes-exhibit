        Artist and technologist inducing delight online and off

      <p>
        I'm a visual artist and technologist based in Brooklyn. In 1994, via the
        mechanism of photography, I discovered a profound appreciation for
        light. I've spent the years since collecting and projecting that light,
        in part having shaped that sensibility via the lens of Parsons School of
        Design.

        I focus my attention equally on digital having worked everything from a
        network administrator to frontend engineer to UI/UX developer roles.
